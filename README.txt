INSTALLATION:
Open the the "index.html" file in any browser.
This can generally be done by dragging the file into an empty tab, or by
dragging the file into a URL bar.
Barring this, launch the "RUN ME (Windows).bat" file, which should open
the page automatically. I included nothing for Linux, because if you're on
it, I feel it's reasonable to expect that you know what you're doing.

USAGE:
Throw your text into the raw input field -- this should update the preview and
the output fields.
Highlight the text in the "Raw Input" field that you'd like to color.
Click a color button.
Magic, I know.

NOTE - THIS IS IMPORTANT - READ IT:
If you change something in the input field, the colors will all evaporate.
It is hard to implement colors that persist through an input update, and I am
still working on it. Thank you for your patience.

STRUCTURE:
Everything is monolithic and kept in the sole HTML file in the folder. Aside
from that, there is the broom closet, which contains a slower-loading version
of the file which I used to generate the color buttons. Don't use it, it's
slower, and the only reason I'd imagine one would have to do so is to spite me.
