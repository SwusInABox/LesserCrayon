PREFACE:
Alright, so, I made this entire thing in about twelve hours on either end of my
writing this file. This is going to break if you try to break it ( hell, it
will probably break regardless, ) so, if you manage to do that, let me know
somehow.

If you think you've got the mental fortitude to sift through the code I wrote
while blacked out on a severe lack of sleep and several gallons of Bang:tm:
Energy Liquid, please submit a PR instead. I thank you for saving me the
trauma, because at this point I am sure that code demons are real.

Also, I apologize for the shit UI/UI scaling, but I have little to no
experience in HTML at this point, so, it's the best I could do.

USAGE:
Throw your text into the raw input field -- this should update the preview and
the output fields.
Highlight the text in the "Raw Input" field that you'd like to color.
Click a color button.
Magic, I know.

NOTE - THIS IS IMPORTANT - READ IT:
If you change something in the input field, the colors will all evaporate.
It is hard to implement colors that persist through an input update, and I am
still working on it. Thank you for your patience.

STRUCTURE:
Everything is monolithic and kept in the sole HTML file in the folder. Aside
from that, there is the broom closet, which contains a slower-loading version
of the file which I used to generate the color buttons. Don't use it, it's
slower, and the only reason I'd imagine one would have to do so is to spite me.
